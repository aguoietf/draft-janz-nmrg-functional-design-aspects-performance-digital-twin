<t>Performance-Oriented Digital Twins (PODTs) provide "what-if" analysis - predictions of performance or, perhaps, of other behaviours in hypothetical situations of network, services, traffic, etc. Key functional and design aspects of PODTs in support of multiple, concurrently-operating use case Management Plane (MP) applications are discussed. Data and model management in concurrent session handling, inter-working with variable composition (from data and functional model perspectives) networks, performance and scalability are considered.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>A Network Digital Twin (NDT) - also referred to as a Digital Network Twin (DNT) - 
   is a virtual replica of a real network (often referred to as a 'physical' network) 
   that faithfully mimics the behaviours of the real network 
   <xref target="I-D.draft-zhou-nmrg-digitaltwin-network-concepts"/>. Its role may be limited
   to synthesizing behavioural information, such as performance predictions,
   for consumption by other MP functions; such analytical Performance-Oriented Digital
   Twins (PODTs) are considered in <xref target="I-D.draft-paillisse-nmrg-performance-digital-twin"/>. 
   Alternatively, the NDT may be held to encompass further management functions, such as 
   closed loop components beyond data analysis, and thus to exercise active control over 
   the physical network, services, etc.  In such cases, the functional equivalent of a 
   PODT lies at the heart of the NDT. Therefore, this draft focuses discussion on PODTs; 
   considerations related to functional extension of the NDT role, beyond an analytical 
   one, are considered in Section 6.</t>

<t>In <xref target="I-D.draft-paillisse-nmrg-performance-digital-twin"/>, PODT implementation challenges
   and certain implementation options - especially concerning key functional models - are discussed, 
   as are required interfaces and related standards (Sections 4 and 7 of the reference, 
   respectively). This draft looks not at details of models or interfaces but rather at 
   general aspects of functional design. Several functional design principles are considered 
   that may apply generically to PODTs.</t>

<t>One such functional design principle is based on the fact that the behavioural or performance
   prediction information, synthesized from data by a particular PODT, may be used by multiple 
   use case-based MP applications, and these applications may - usefully - operate concurrently.
   What is different among such applications - or even among successive predictions sought by
   a single application - is not the nature of the behavioural or performance information yielded.
   The difference lies, rather, in the details of the scenarios for which prediction information 
   is sought. A PODT supporting multiple concurrent MP functions and applications requires careful 
   handling of data and modeling to accommodate differences in scenario-driven data used in (what
   amount to) parallel - or at least, different - computational sessions. This aspect is 
   considered in Section 3.</t>

<t>Another important functional design principle is related to the fact that, in practice, there
   are likely to be - among real network instances for which use of the PODT is desired, or with 
   respect to evolutions of a given real network instance over time - considerable variations in 
   network details, including network size, equipment types used, available instrumentation or 
   other data sources, etc. Additionally, differences among MP applications, in terms of the nature
   and degree of hypotheticals involved in the scenarios they generate for performance prediction, 
   may also drive variations in data types, availability, precision, etc. As a practical matter, a
   PODT should be able to accommodate such variations, while consistently providing the best possible
   scenario-based performance predictions in support of all MP applications. This, too, has 
   implications for data and model management. This aspect is considered in Section 4.</t>

<t>Finally, supporting multiple, concurrently operating MP applications - many of which (e.g. 
   optimization-related applications) may require performance prediction on large numbers of different,
   detailed scenarios - requires high-performance PODT implementations. Models may be more or less 
   complicated and computationally intensive; data consumed may be considerable and run to large 
   archived volumes over time. Performance and scalability considerations are discussed in 
   Section 5.</t>

<section anchor="data-and-model-management-supporting-concurrent-scenario-based-computational-sessions"><name>Data and Model Management Supporting Concurrent Scenario-Based Computational Sessions</name>

<t>That multiple use case-based MP applications may rely on the same PODT-based analytical 
   function and information that it synthesizes, is illustrated in 
   <xref target="I-D.draft-paillisse-nmrg-performance-digital-twin"/>: for greater simplicity and coherence,
   what follows refers specifically to the use cases associated with the Optical Performance
   Digital Twin (OPDT) that are described in that reference (Section 6). However, as discussed
   in the reference, several of these use cases have generic counter-parts (i.e. are applicable
   to networks other than optical transmission networks) and, additionally, further use case
   categories are considered.</t>

<t>With respect to OPDTs, <xref target="I-D.draft-paillisse-nmrg-performance-digital-twin"/> describes
   the following use cases:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
(1) Optical service (re-)provisioning

(2.a) Optical service/network risk planning
(2.b) Optical service/network dynamic restoration planning

(3) Optical service planning

(4) Optical network planning (incremental/brown field to green field)

(5) Optical services/network optimization
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that:
    (1) describes an active operation undertaken on deployed and operating optical 
    networks, potentially in an automation or semi-automation context; 
    (2.a) and (2.b) describe potentially coupled analysis &amp; planning operations that may be 
     undertaken periodically or on an event-driven basis on deployed and operating optical networks, 
     potentially in an automation or semi-automation context;
    (3) describes a planning operation, that may be undertaken periodically or on an event-driven
     basis on deployed and operating optical networks, potentially in an automation or semi-automation 
     context;<br />
    (4) describes a planning operation, relevant to either deployed and operating optical networks 
     or to hypothetical future optical networks. In either context, optical service planning (3) may 
     be an 'embedded' function;
    (5) describes an 'embedded' function used in support of (2) through (4).</t>

<t>All of these use cases may be handled by MP applications that rely on the same OPDT - or at least
   the same type and style of OPDT - generating the same type and format of transmission performance 
   information (predictions) from the same fundamental data, using fundamentally the same models. The 
   differences consist in the detailed sourcing of data - in particular, between real network and service 
   data and postulated, hypothetical data - and in the detailed usage of models. For example, the 
   OPDT-based modeling implicated in cases (1) and (3) above involves performance, status and other 
   data strictly from the network as-deployed and operating, but also involves at least partly hypothetical
   postulated optical service states. On the other hand, the OPDT-based modeling implicated in 
   cases (2) and (4) involves performance, equipment specification and status, and other network data 
   that is at least partly (and may be wholly - e.g. green field planning) hypothetical, as well as at 
   least partly (and potentially wholly) hypothetical optical service states. All of these applications, 
   and especially the potentially embedded application case (5), furthermore involve some degree of 
   sequential or parallel presentation of multiple, partly differing scenarios for performance prediction.</t>

<t>Accommodating these realities requires (ideally) concurrent operation of multiple, scenario-based 
   computational 'sessions', requiring careful management of the different data sets and models involved 
   in each, as well as of their differing life cycles. Note that whether a given implementation is better 
   described as operating concurrent sessions of the same OPDT, or as concurrently operating multiple OPDT
   instances of the same type, is largely a distinction without a meaningful difference for purposes of 
   this discussion.</t>

<t>OPDT (or, more broadly, PODT) computational sessions - in the sense just described - thus make use of 
   network, service and other data that generally only partly map to current (or historical) data from the 
   real twin. However, that 'real' data must remain accessible to every session and uncorrupted by the partial
   substitution of real data with hypothetical data occurring differentially in each session, while being 
   continuously updated and kept current with new data from the real network, management and control systems,
   etc. There are different implementation methods available to achieve this, but careful design and 
   implementation is critical.</t>

<t>Different PODT computational sessions also generally involve different detailed functional model 
   compositions. First, scenarios may involve additions to, deletions from, or other modifications to the 
   set of deployed equipment or other elements, changes in connection configurations, etc. Where network 
   functional models are generated through composition from atomic equipment or element instances and their 
   related models, differential network model composition by scenario-based session is clearly required. 
   Second, details of functional models invoked may differ depending on whether the counter-part to the 
   digital instance is real - i.e. deployed and potentially operating - or hypothetical. For example, in 
   the case of OPDTs, the important erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) network element is a critical 
   focal point for functional modeling. Such functional models may be - in increasing 
   order of accuracy and precision - generic, type-specific but instance-generic, or both type-and 
   instance-specific. Where the scenario-based network is fully deployed and operational, the latter models 
   may be available and will yield more accurate performance predictions than the alternatives; whereas 
   if the scenario-based network is entirely hypothetical (e.g. green field planning) then only 
   type-specific models may be available (and would be preferred to generic models). This issue will 
   be re-visited in Section 4.</t>

<t>Finally, scenario-based computational session life cycles must be managed. Such sessions may be short-lived, 
   e.g. seeking one-time "what-if" scenario-based predictions; or, they may be long-lived, e.g. seeking 
   continuous generation of prediction data as real twin-sourced data evolves. MP application consumers of PODT-generated information control these life cycles, but PODT implementations must be equipped 
   to manage them.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-and-model-management-supporting-differences-and-evolutions-in-mp-applications-and-physical-networks"><name>Data and Model Management Supporting Differences and Evolutions in MP Applications and Physical Networks</name>

<t>In practical application, PODTs are likely to be required to operate in conjunction with real networks that 
   vary in a number of ways, including network size, specific equipment types involved, available 
   instrumentation or other data sources, types and quality, etc. Additionally, as discussed in Section 3, 
   differences among MP applications - in terms of the nature and degree of hypotheticals involved in the 
   scenarios they generate for performance prediction - may also drive variations in data types, availability,
   precision, etc. PODTs should be able to accommodate these variations, while always providing the best 
   possible scenario-based performance predictions. This has implications for both session-based functional 
   model management and data management.</t>

<t>As a rule, the network functional models 'composed' for each MP application-driven PODT computational 
   session, should make use of the most accurate atomic functional models available and usable under the 
   circumstances. For example, as discussed in Section 3, better functional models may be available when a 
   given network element is deployed and operating - its type and potentially instance-specific information 
   thus being known - than when it is a hypothetical element, in which case, only generic or type-specific 
   models may be available. Further, a real network may include equipment types for which type- and 
   instance-specific models are not available; in such cases, generic models must be used, or a selection 
   made from type-specific models thought to best represent the behaviours of the real equipment in question.</t>

<t>Available data to 'feed' functional models may also vary according to circumstances of both real network 
   and MP application-driven scenarios. Functional models and available data should be used in flexible 
   combination to deliver the best possible performance predictions under all circumstances. This idea may
   be illustrated with an example based on optical transmission networks and OPDTs. Channel input powers
   to the various optical amplifiers in the network represent important input data to amplifier functional 
   models. If a given modeled amplifier is deployed and operating, then channel input powers - for channels 
   currently operating - may possibly be measured on the real network directly at amplifier inputs. If such 
   measurements are not available, or the optical service channel in question is only a hypothetical, 
   prospective channel, or if the scenario for modeling includes other hypothetical changes to the network 
   or service configuration or state; then alternatives must be sought. For example, if optical fibre link 
   losses are accurately known at proximate channel wavelengths, they may be used in conjunction with measured
   or modeled channel powers at upstream points to estimate amplifier ingress powers. Note that fibre link 
   losses may have been obtained by direct or indirect measurement - meaning, in the latter case, inferred 
   from available data (e.g. fibre link input and output powers on proximate operating channel wavelengths). 
   Finally, if fibre link losses are not accurately known - for example, in brown or green field planning 
   scenarios, such data may not be available in respect of prospective incremental or new fibre plant - 
   default loss coefficients and hypothesized fibre link lengths may be used to generate fibre link loss 
   estimations.</t>

<t>Again: functional models and available data should be used in flexible combination to deliver the best 
   possible performance predictions under all circumstances. Increased 'instrumentation' of the real network 
   - scope and quality of relevant data generation - reduces the scope and degree of required modeling and 
   leads to improved performance prediction results, but modeling may generally be used in combination with 
   available data to close 'gaps' in such instrumentation. In respect of any needed input data to elements
   of session-based composed network functional models, a 'preference hierarchy' of data, and sources of 
   data, may be established a priori and used in operation. For example, considering the case of the prior 
   paragraph: if directly measured channel input power is available, use it; if not, and if measured proximate 
   channel fibre link losses have been directly measured, use them; if not, use default loss coefficient for 
   the posited fibre type and length. Data 'tables' may be dynamic and built up through increasing measurement 
   experience, and even PODT-based functional modeling experience, with respect to a given real or (partly)
   hypothetical network. Increasing effective data quality may thus yield improvements in performance prediction
   quality over time - over and above the impacts of any experience-driven improvement to functional models.</t>

<t>It should also be noted that flexible conjoint use of data and models may yield ways to verify 
   the accuracy of data and models, through 'prediction of measurables' - i.e. using modeling to generate data 
   which is in fact directly measurable or available on the real network. For example, fibre link losses or 
   channel power measurements may be used to 'predict' - i.e., to use functional models to calculate - the 
   optical signal to noise ratio of an operating channel at each point in an amplified transmission span. If 
   such ratios are in fact directly measured by available network instrumentation, then the measured and 
   'modeled' values, in respect of operating optical service channels, may be compared. Differences may be 
   due to either data/measurement inaccuracies, functional model accuracy limitations, or both. Where 
   functional models have been established to be accurate, discrepancies may indicate variations in data - 
   assumed or measured vs. 'actual' - that may prove useful in e.g. 'soft fault' detection, 
   classification or localization.</t>

<section anchor="performance-related-functional-design-aspects"><name>Performance-Related Functional Design Aspects</name>

<t>The support of multiple, concurrently operating MP applications 
   - many of which (e.g. optimization-related applications) may require performance prediction on large 
   numbers of different, detailed scenarios - requires high-performance PODT implementations. Functional models themselves may be more or less complicated and computationally-intensive, and data consumed may be considerable and run to large archive volumes over time.High-performance data collection methodologies are considered in <xref target="I-D.draft-zcz-nmrg-digitaltwin-data-collection"/>. Data comes from other MP applications e.g. network or service configuration, from managed entities – the real network – or from the real network through MP applications.</t>

<t>Various techniques can be used to support high-performance PODT to support functional design and implementation. The common idea is to split functional modeling into smaller tasks. Such tasks can be of two types: having dependencies on other tasks, or independent of other tasks. Independent tasks can be assigned to different compute resources (workers), and executed in parallel:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>In an embedded system, a multiple worker-thread strategy can be used to support high performance;</t>
  <t>On a server-based platform, a PODT may run under a microservices architecture, with workers located in difference processors or on different servers depending on the size and complexity of the emulated network. These distributed computing systems can greatly improve performance and support complex functional modeling of large-scale networks and concurrent sessions supporting multiple MP applications.</t>
  <t>Processors on real network elements can serve as distributed worker resources as well, performing functional modeling tasks directly related to them, and easy computational requirements on server-based platforms.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Dependent tasks need orchestration to schedule, synchronize and dispatch compute requests to tasks. Stream processing framework - like Kafka – are effective frameworks to support this.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="functional-design-implications-of-ndt-functional-extension-beyond-analysis"><name>Functional Design Implications of NDT Functional Extension Beyond Analysis</name>

<t>As described in Section 1 (and in e.g. <xref target="I-D.draft-zhou-nmrg-digitaltwin-network-concepts"/>), 
   some functional conceptions of NDTs extend beyond the analytical function of PODTs to encompass
   further management functions, such as closed loop components extending to decision and action. 
   Such NDTs may thus exercise active control over the real network, service configurations, etc.<br />
   However, in such cases, the functional equivalent of a PODT lies at the heart of the NDT - i.e. 
   representing the data and analysis closed loop components. Therefore, the PODT-specific functional 
   design aspects considered in this document may be considered to apply to NDTs broadly, with the 
   qualification that what amount to the MP applications driving and using the functional equivalent of PODTs - in the manner described in this document - are partly or wholly encompassed within the 
   functional perimeter of the NDT.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conclusion"><name>Conclusion</name>

<t>PODTs represent an important class of NDTs in their own right, and their functional equivalent lies at the heart of NDTs with active network-driving capabilities. The ‘what-if’ scenarios analyzed by PODTs are generated by various use case-oriented MP applications. Information and model management among concurrent computational sessions, driven by such MP applications, is thus an important functional design concern. Also important is information and model management to accommodate variations and evolutions among real network co-operating with PODTs. Functional design for high and scalable operational performance is a further important functional design criterion.</t>

	 <t>   This draft introduces the concept of a Network Digital Twin (NDT) for
   performance evaluation, a so-called Performance-Oriented Digital Twin
   (PODT).  Two types of PODTs are described.  The first, referred to as
   a Network Performance Digital Twin (NPDT), produces performance
   estimates (delay, jitter, loss) for a packet network with a specified
   topology, traffic demand, and routing and scheduling configuration.
   The second, referred to as an Optical Performance Digital Twin
   (OPDT), produces transmission performance estimates of an optical
   network with specified optical service topologies and network
   equipment types, topology and status.  This draft also discusses
   interfaces to these digital twins, how these digital twins relate to
   existing control plane elements, and describes use cases for these
   digital twins, as well as possible implementation options.

	 <t>   A Digital Twin Network is a virtual representation of a physical
   network, which is meant to be used by a management system to analyze,
   diagnose, emulate and control the physical network based on
   monitoring information, data, models, and interfaces.  The
   construction and state update of a Digital Twin Network require
   obtaining real-time information of the physical network it represents
   (i.e., telemetry data).  This document aims to describe the data
   collection requirements and provide data collection methods or tools
   to build the data repository for building and updating a digital twin
   network.
